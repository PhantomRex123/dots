# Why ? 
I wanted to share my dotfiles which i have been working on for some time ! These are all mainly stolen, and referbished :).

## Information : 
After doing this project i loved haskell. I enjoy the language !

## The future : 
I'm moving to fedora. I propebly won't update these dots anymore!! I shall still try.

## Neovim configs :

### Why didn't i include dotfiles?
> I don't use neovim, i like VI more. Less configuration. Faster load time. Better Keybindings. Yet, i only took a picture of it because it looks good. i would never use this myself. Its just made for looks, not development.

## What about the installer ? 
I will learn bash in order to make the best out of the installer. It will come very soon!
